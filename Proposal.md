## Description

I built a very rudimentary reddit bot over winter break. I currently listens for the comment "prison mike" then responds with a gif.

## Objective 1: Have the bot maintain a db that it can query and save who's summoned it. and How many times. Current version just writes a file.
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
It will help keep better logs of the bot being used. And by who.
**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
The bot will have a a count and a map of users who've called it and or commented under it.
## Objective 2: Make the bot more dynamic. Add more responses to different things. Put the bot in a class instead of having it just be functional.
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
It will make the but more interesting to interact with for other users on the social media platform.
**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
The bought will have more things it's listening too and more pre baked responses.
## Objective 3: Fix the current memory leak it has. 
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
Currentlt the bot has an up time of around 4 hours at a time. I want to get that to 100%
**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
The bot wont restart every day after a few hours .
## Stretch goals (optional):
